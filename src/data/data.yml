        text: Working half time and studying full time, I graduated with a summa-cum-laude Master's degree on the subject of "Temporal and Spatial Alert Correlation for the Detection of Advanced Persistent Threats" in 2019. I was part of a special cooperation between the University of Hamburg, the Fraunhofer Institute Singapore, and the Nanyang Technological University Singapore, where I spent my final year. My Master's Thesis has won two prizes since then for innovative excellence in the cybersecurity industry.
